# An introductory p5.js curriculum 
A curriculum for students with low computer literacy to learn the basics of p5.js

This curriculum currently has 8 (soon to be 10) modules. It is intended to be delivered in person to learners without much familiarity with computers. However, the instructions in each module have been written so that a learner should be able to follow along without in-person guidance.

For a brief outline of the course, view the Course Outline document.

Modules 2, 3 & 4 can be skipped if the learners are familiar with computers (and using a web broswer) and are seeking detailed instructions on how to start creative coding in p5.js.

Modules are available in PDF and OpenDocument formats for ease of use and editing. Feel free to modify the curriculum in whatever way you see fit.
